# LCR-Emailer

A mostly automated solution for emailing Kumon Level Completion Reports (LCR).

Using PDFs and Excel spreadsheets generated by Kumon's proprietary CMS software, the program can automatically generate and send templated emails containing information about a student's performance at the end of each level.

## Installation

1. [Install Python 3.](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) Ensure the options for installing pip and adding python to PATH are selected. Detailed instructions can be found [here.](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/pythoneclipsejava/python.html)

2. Install xlrd by opening the command prompt and entering `pip install xlrd`

3. [Download](https://github.com/Sebastian-/LCR-Emailer/releases) the lcr.py program.

## Usage

### General Overview

This program will accept end-of-level math and reading Excel spreadsheets generated by CMS. Based on that information, a folder for each passing student is created. Each folder will contain a copy of the email template, which has been filled in with the student's test information. Then, level completion reports are manually exported as PDFs into their respective student's folder and everything is sent out to the parent's email address. If the report cannot be sent, it is placed in a "To Print" folder.
